## Featured Project: **Introvert vs. Extrovert Personality Classifier**

### Project Summary
Using behavioral and social indicators, this project classifies individuals as **Introverts** or **Extroverts** using machine learning models and SHAP explainability.

- **Dataset**: 2,900 entries, 9 features + engineered variables
- **Models**: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, CatBoost
- **Best Model**: Tuned Random Forest (F1 score ≈ 0.93)
- **Key Insight**: `Social Comfort Index` was the most predictive feature

## Skills Demonstrated

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
  - Handling missing values with `SimpleImputer`, `KNNImputer`
  - Encoding categorical variables using `OrdinalEncoder`, `OneHotEncoder`
  - Feature scaling with `MinMaxScaler`
  
- **Feature Engineering**
  - Created new features (`Social Comfort Index`, `Alone-to-Social Ratio`)
  - Used domain knowledge to inform transformations

- **Model Building**
  - Trained multiple classifiers and optimized using `RandomizedSearchCV`
  - Evaluated with `F1 Score`, `Confusion Matrix`

- **Explainability**
  - Extracted feature importances
  - Used `SHAP` to interpret model decisions visually and quantitatively

## Tools & Libraries

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, SHAP, CatBoost, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Version control with Git
- Model evaluation and explainability techniques
